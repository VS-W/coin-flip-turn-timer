Designed to be used on a phone/tablet placed between the players.

Currently tracks the total time taken by a player.

## TODO:
- Add display for current player turn time.
- Add a history coin flips, plus total count of each outcome.
- Adapt font size for really small screens.
- Confirmation on reset.
- Write to localstorage to survive page refresh.
