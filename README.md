# Turn Timer + Coin Flip

A simple turn timer with a coin flip function. Designed to be used on a phone/tablet placed between the players.

Tap on the green button or the time display to start the timer for that player. Tapping on the opposing button/time display will switch to tracking that player's time. When the timer is active, the current player's button will change a red pause button enabling that player to pause their timer.

Currently tracks the *total* time taken by a player.

## TODO:
- Add display for current player turn time.
- Add a history coin flips, plus total count of each outcome.
- Adapt font size for really small screens.
- Confirmation on reset.
- Write to localstorage to survive page refresh.
